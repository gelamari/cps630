	(1, 'Jeremy Jordan', 4, 'I JUST LOVED MY VISIT TO THE EIFFEL TOWER. THIS WAS MY FIRST VISIT AND I WAS AMAZED AT HOW BIG IT IS IN PERSON. IT STANDS MUCH WIDER THAN IT LOOKS ON THE PICTURES I HAVE SEEN. I HEARD THE STORIES ABOUT THE PICK-POCKETS AROUND THE EIFFEL TOWER SO I WAS EXTRA CAREFUL BUT I DIDN\'T SEE ANY INCIDENTS WITH THE GROUP I WAS WITH. THE SECOND LEVEL IS A GREAT PLACE TO ENJOY THE VIEW AND SEE THE WHOLE OF PARIS! THE ELEVATORS WERE A BIT CROWDED SO I DECIDED TO TAKE THE STAIRS DOWN TO THE 1ST LEVEL. THERE ARE A LOT OF WINDING STAIRS IN THE TOWER BUT IT WAS A NICE EXPERIENCE. THERE ARE SEVERAL SHOPS AND EATERIES IN THE TOWER TOO! SOME OF THE SOUVENIRS ARE MORE EXPENSIVE THAN YOU MIGHT FIND IN THE SHOPS ACROSS THE STREET SO YOU MAY WANT TO CHECK OTHER PLACES OUT AS WELL. IF YOU DON\'T WANT TO SPEND A LOT ON YOUR MEAL STOP BY THE MILLENIA TOUR EIFFEL FOR A SNACK.', 1, '2016-01-10'),

	(10, ' Hudson Joshua Creighton', 5, 'This is a traditional Chinese garden and one of the best instances of the art of gardening in this country. The interaction of the main elements of Chinese gardens: buildings, rockeries, water and plants fill the garden of hidden maenings. The visitor must walk around its 6 main components, relaxing in each one of them to discover the real value of these landscapes in the Chinese mind.\r\n', 5, '2019-12-01'),
	(11, 'George Swane', 3, 'Was okay. More of a protected space than a national stadium compared to what we were used to in the states. We drove thru on our scooter and found a nice viewpoint where we did some yoga which was the best part.\r\n', 6, '2019-11-10'),
	(12, 'Amelia Mary', 4, 'Great track behind Kep, easy gradient, easy track until you go to find the sunset look out.\r\nPretty tough trail, need decent shoes, plenty of water and a decent map.\r\nIt\'s a maze in there go prepared and your fine underestimate it and you could pay a hefty price', 6, '2018-12-12'),
	(13, 'Bessie Waldo', 5, 'You could spend all day following the trails to the top of the mountain. We went only about a third up the mountain, but it was beautiful and peaceful. Each gate is donated by a family across Japan. It may have been less crowded the further up you go, but we didn’t have enough time. Also great street food/snack vendors at the bottom of the shrine.\r\n', 7, '2020-02-10'),

	(15, 'Helen Loraine', 5, 'Good range of marine life and animals. Whale sharks are amazing just a shame they are in an aquarium. The tanks are huge to give all the creatures as much space as possible. The area outside the aquarium had magnificent christmas decorations\r\n', 8, '2013-11-11'),
	(16, 'Hudson Trevor', 4, 'I have been to a few aquariums in my life however, this was the first one that lets you see the animals upclose!!!! I do not know what they (Aquarium management) did to make the animals come closer to the glass, but IT WORKS! We came on a Friday night and did not have to queue up to enter at all! So glad we came, because we almost skip this due to the high price! we paid about RM86 per person from klook.com (about USD21).\r\n', 8, '2015-12-12'),
	(17, 'Alice Catherine Cleave', 4, 'We\'ve been coming to Bahia Palace since the first month they opened over 20 years ago. We have stayed at Caribe, Tropical and the Palace. They are all wonderful but in our old age we really love the Palace now. Superb beaches at all, excellent accommodations, wonderful restaurants, beautiful and interesting grounds and so much to do. Terrific staff as well.\r\n', 9, '2018-04-05'),
	(18, 'Kornelia Theodosia', 5, 'The atmosphere was very relaxing yet there were plenty of activities available. The food was excellent and it was always clean and well kept. The staff was very friendly. We would stay here again on our next trip to Cancun.\r\n', 9, '2017-03-24'),
	(19, 'Charlotte Lane', 4, 'One week is a solid amount of time to explore Morocco\'s desert and Imperial cities at a moderate pace. In two weeks, you can add hiking in the Atlas Mountains and relaxation on the Atlantic coast. With less than 5 days, it\'s best to focus your time: see Casablanca, Chefchaouen, and Fes in the north, or stick to Marrakech and the Sahara in the south.\r\n', 10, '2020-02-02'),
	(20, 'Ramon Artagaveytia', 5, 'Taroudant is a small, fortified city rising out of the southern Moroccan desert 80km inland from Agadir. The climate presents a challenge to designers, but Saad El Kabbaj, Driss Kettani and Mohamed Amine Siana have scored a remarkable success in terms of both function and aesthetics. The 11 low blocks of their university campus surround a long riad or enclosed garden filled with argan trees, which forms an open street linking the facilities and giving views out over the Atlas Mountains. The blocks are also grouped around four subsidiary courtyards, providing more shade and cooling air. The red rendered exterior of the buildings refers to the colour of the desert and the city’s ancient walls, without being explicitly historicist, and the limited fenestration avoids excessive solar gain.\r\n', 10, '2016-03-04'),
	(21, 'Rosalie Bidois', 4, 'The best thing about the fort is that its free to get in, and some nice photos can be made from its walls ramparts and amphitheatre. however there is not much literature setting out the history of the site and the internal are full of stalls selling the usual tourist tat and Henna tattoos.\r\n', 11, '2019-03-24'),
	(22, 'Caroline Louise Endres', 4, 'I thought this fort had so much potential, but is under utilized and developed. It is free to get in, so that is a plus. Make sure you visit the art gallery in one of the turrets to get a good view and walk along the wall. They do use the amphitheater for productions, which is fantastic. A number of stalls to meander around and even a restaurant. It was good to see local people using the space to chill out.\r\n', 11, '2019-12-01'),
	(23, 'Léontine Pauline', 4, 'The Great Mosque is the best part of the ruins on the island of Kilwa Kisiwani. When you see photos of the island, this is often the spot where they were taken. The arches make for interesting photography.\r\n', 12, '2019-07-08'),

	(25, 'Algernon Henry Wilson', 4, 'This attraction took longer than we anticipated. We bought tickets same day and waited 1.5 hours in line to get through security and to the ferry. Ferry ride was quick and there were affordable snacks and drinks available. Once at Liberty, the museum was great and seeing the status was nice. Also, great photos of NYC. The self tour listening devices were pretty worthless to us. Very nice trip that everyone should take.\r\n', 13, '2020-01-20'),

	(29, 'Sallie Beckwith', 5, 'Fantastic View from 100\'s of meters in the air. Once the tallest structure in the world, this place will always satisfy. I\'ve never found line ups and the ride in the elevator is an experience in itself. Try out the dinning at the top of the Cn tower. decent food for a decent price considering.\r\n', 15, '2019-03-21'),
	(30, 'Jakob Birnbaum', 4, 'What can I say? Beautiful views; went on a slow day so wait was super short. We literally went in and out in less than 30 minutes. Took great photographs; is its must see? Sure if you purchase the City Pass then yes if not its another city view like a lot of others that ive been to.\r\n', 15, '2019-12-24'),
	(31, 'Helen Bishop', 3, 'If you have seen castles elsewhere I\'m not sure why you would want to see this relatively small place. But if you have never been inside anywhere bigger than a bungalow, or older than the 1950\'s, they you would find this interesting.\r\n', 16, '2020-01-10'),
	(32, 'Stephen Blackwell', 4, 'Beautiful castle and gardens. Well worth a visit and you need a good few hours to get round. Don’t forget the underground tunnel to the stables area. This would be a brilliant area for afternoon tea but I think you would have to book in advance (fully booked today)\r\n', 16, '2020-02-05'),
	(33, 'Henry Blank', 4, 'Having seen the Opera House many times from the outside, it was great to get behind the scenes.Our guide was very knowledgeable and much was learnt. The only disappointment was that the Concert Hall was being refurbished.\r\n', 17, '2018-07-07'),
	(34, 'Elizabeth Bonnell', 5, 'Do yourself a favor and take the tour. The tour guides are very knowledgeable and will answer all your questions. I also like the fact that your provided headphones so you can hear the tour guide without straining. The Opera House is an amazing achievement of architecture.\r\n', 17, '2020-02-18'),
	(35, 'Caroline Bonnell', 5, 'This was our first visit and didn’t know what to expect. There are a selection of tours covering various aspects of the prisons history.Each tour is around one and a quarter hours and is very comprehensive. Amazing that it only closed in 1991 when most of the facilities,and the cells hadn’t really moved forward on 150 years. Well worth the visit and will be returning for another visit soon.', 18, '2020-02-05'),
	(36, 'John Bertram', 5, 'Fascinating to learn about the history from the perspective of the prison and the importance of the convicts in establishing the community. Very knowledgeable guides make this a must do trip.\r\n', 18, '2020-01-29'),
	(37, 'George Andrew', 5, 'We walked around the gardens first, and they are quite beautiful. The views through the trees towards the harbor and city are very nice. The castle itself is small, but has a rich history and fabulous woodwork and craftsmanship. The house has been restored quite nicely, and the audio/video tour really gives a lot of detailed information. There are videos of the current owners describing what it was like growing up in the castle. Would recommend for a visit.\r\n', 19, '2018-09-09'),
	(38, 'Arthur Jackson', 4, 'Beautiful gardens, lots of lovely garden rooms, great views. We followed the directions on the site map we were given on arrival. This led us throughout the whole of the gardens. Then we went up the steps leading to the front door of the castle. It didn’t look like what I thought a castle should look like, but still it was ok. We walked through all of the rooms, some were better than others, it’s slowly being restored and it’s not quite finished yet. One of the rooms was really interesting as the floor had a very large slope to one side. The winding to the stairs up to the roof were fun, great views from the top. We then had amazing Devonshire tea in the cafe there. The scones were hot, light and fluffy. With heaps of raspberry jam and whipped cream.\r\n', 19, '2019-04-05'),
	(39, 'Annie Moore Ward', 4, 'It was easy to walk away when the tour was mentioned costing $5 pp. But we took it and it was fascinating and worth every cent. It was not long but great to hear about the Cathedral , construction, Christchurch post quakes and this cathedral leads in sustainability. Buy the tour tickets from the desk in the shop. Do it - well worth the time.\r\n', 20, '2020-02-01'),
	(40, 'Frans Olof', 4, 'We decided to take the guided tour of this Transitional Cathedral, as we had seen it before but never taken the tour. We had a very knowledgeable guide who explained to us how it was made ( on a concrete raft-like structure) and yes it is made of cardboard and other sustainable materials. It is an amazing building, and is used for the good of the community. Worth a short walk out of the city centre to see it.\r\n', 20, '2017-05-06');
